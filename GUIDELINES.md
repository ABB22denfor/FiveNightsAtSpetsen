# Guidelines

Teacher characters are identified by their name in lowercase, which is used as an ID. Example: `Lars Fryxell` has the ID `lars`.

Variables should be written in camelCase:
```csharp 
int myVariable = 0;
```

Methods and classes should be defined in PascalCase:
```csharp
class MyClass {
    void MyMethod(){

    }
}
```

Arguments should be written in snake_case:
```csharp
void MyMethod(int my_arg, string my_string_arg)
```

All files and folders should be written in PascalCase:
```txt
MyCodeFile.cs  MyPrefab.prefab  MyModelFolder/MyModel.fbx
```
